kubectl get pods -n nginx -o wide


NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP        NODE                 NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

### ðŸ§  **Explanation**

This output shows:

* Namespace: `nginx`
* Two Pods from the deployment `nginx-deployment`
* Both Pods are **Running** and **Ready (1/1)**
* Each pod is running on a different node (`tws-cluster-worker` and `tws-cluster-worker3`)
* The `-o wide` option includes extra details like the Pod IPs and node names.

  ===
so  pod 'nginx-deployment-6f59995b97-d41mm ' running on the tws-cluster-worker  worker node adn this worker node is a docker container
hence , i will use 
'docker ps'   

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-22:~/kubernetes-in-one-shot/nginx$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS         PORTS                                          NAMES

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-22:~/kubernetes-in-one-shot/nginx$ docker exec -it 8f000


--- so here this   tws-cluster-worker is the worker node whose container id is '8f00050a99f3' , i will enter in this container(orworkernode) 
using docker exec -it 8f00050a99f3 bash
 i will go cd mnt/data and this is the path which is mount
