### ðŸ§  **Explanation**

This output shows:

* Namespace: `nginx`
* Two Pods from the deployment `nginx-deployment`
* Both Pods are **Running** and **Ready (1/1)**
* Each pod is running on a different node (`tws-cluster-worker` and `tws-cluster-worker3`)
* The `-o wide` option includes extra details like the Pod IPs and node names.

  ===
so  pod 'nginx-deployment-6f59995b97-d41mm ' running on the tws-cluster-worker  worker node
